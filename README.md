# Clincover

Clincover is a prototype coverage testing tool for answer set programms. It uses the power of the integrated ASP system clingo to calculate five different code coverage metrics defined by [Janhunen et al.](https://doi.org/10.3233/978-1-60750-606-5-951). Two versions exist: One for propositional normal programs (clincover.py) and one that works with all types of ASP programs (clincovar.py).

## Usage
usage: clincover.py [-h] [-p] [-r] [-d] [-l] [-c] [-v] -t
                    TESTCASES [TESTCASES ...]
                    files [files ...]



positional arguments:  
&emsp;    files  &emsp;&emsp;  The program files

optional arguments:  
  -h,&emsp; --help      &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;      show this help message and exit  
  -p,&emsp; --program   &nbsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;      check for program coverage  
  -r,&emsp;&nbsp; --rule      &emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;      check for rule coverage  
  -d,&emsp; --definition &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;      check for definition coverage  
  -l,&emsp;&nbsp; --loop       &emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;     check for loop coverage  
  -c,&emsp; --component  &emsp;&emsp;     check for component coverage  
  -v,&emsp; --verbose    &ensp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;     display additional coverage
                        information like locations  
  -t TESTCASES [TESTCASES ...],&emsp; --testcases TESTCASES [TESTCASES ...]&emsp;&emsp;
                        The testcase files

## Examples
There is an example program as well as test case for both the propositional version and the extended version showcasing different language constructs.  
Example of computing all five coverage metrics:  
```bash
python clincover.py examples/example_program.lp -t examples/example_testcase.lp -p -r -d -l -c -v
```
